Hybrid RNAseq Transcription Factor Screen README

This pipeline is used to process RNA-seq data from Mus musculus x M. spretus interspecific hybrid cells and combine it with ChIP-seq and VCF data collected from publicly available databases for use in our novel transcription factor screen outlined in the following preprint: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.21.489100v2
ChIP-seq data is collected from the Gene Transcription Regulation Database: https://gtrd.biouml.org/
VCF data is collected from The Mouse Genome Project: https://www.sanger.ac.uk/data/mouse-genomes-project/

Scripts labeled 1-6 are used to process RNA-seq data in parallel to get TPM counts.
7ANOVA.R is used to identify genes showing condition specific ASE, and the second part is used to identify candidate TFs using the output from script 9.
Scripts 8 and 9 are used to organize ChIP-seq and VCF data into nested dictionaries for faster searching, and generate data identify candidate TFs.
